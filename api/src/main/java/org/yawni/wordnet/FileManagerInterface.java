/**
 * {@code FileManagerInterface} defines the interface between {@link WordNet} and the data file system.
 * {@code WordNet} invokes methods from this interface to retrieve lines of text from the
 * WordNet data files.
 *
 * <p> Methods in this interface take filenames as arguments.  The filename is the name of
 * a WordNet file, and is relative to the database directory (e.g., {@code data.noun}, not
 * {@code dict/data.noun}).
 *
 * <p> Methods in this interface operate on and return pointers, which are indices into the
 * file named by filename.
 *
 * <p> {@code FileManagerInterface} was originally designed to work efficiently across a network.  To this end, it obeys
 * two design principles:  1) it uses only primitive types (including {@code String}) as argument and return types,
 * and 2) operations that search a file for a line with a specific property are provided by the
 * server.  The first principle ensures that scanning a database won't create a large number of remote objects that
 * must then be queried and garbage-collected (each requiring an additional <abbr title="Remote Procedure Call">RPC</abbr>).  The second
 * principle avoids paging an entire database file across the network in order to search for
 * an entry.
 *
 * <p> Making {@code WordNet} {@linkplain java.io.Serializable} would violate the first of these properties
 * (it would require that {@link Word}, {@link Synset}, {@link POS}, {@link WordSense}, etc. also be supported as remote objects);
 * a generic remote file system interface would violate the second.
 *
 * <p> A third design principle is that sessions are <em>stateless</em> -- this simplifies the
 * implementation of the server.  A consequence of this
 * principle together with the restriction of return values to primitives is that pairs
 * of operations such as {@code getNextLinePointer}/{@code readLineAt} are required in order to step through
 * a file.  The implementor of {@code FileManagerInterface} can cache the file position before and
 * after {@code readLineAt} in order to eliminate the redundant I/O activity that a na√Øve implementation
 * of these methods would necessitate.
