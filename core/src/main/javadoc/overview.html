<title>JWordNet API</title>
</head>
<body>
<p> JWordNet is a high-performance, pure Java standalone object-oriented interface to the WordNet
    database of lexical and semantic relationships.
    Here's a simple example of how to use JWordNet for XXX (using JUnit
    to check if the results are what we expect): </p>

<div class="java" align="left">
<table bgcolor="#ffffff" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0">
   <tbody>
   <tr>
     <td align="left" nowrap="nowrap" valign="top">
       <code>
       code example...
       </code>
     </td>
   </tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</div>

<p> The JWordNet API is has only a few public classes: </p>
<ul>
  <li> Word </li>
  <li> POS </li>
  <li> WordSense </li>
  <li> Synset </li>
  <li> Pointer </li>
  <li> PointerType </li>
</ul>
