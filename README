Changes in version 1.1

JWordnet 1.1 provides support for Wordnet 2.0 data files.  It includes pointer types for derived relationships as well as domain membership.

The code has been slightly upgraded to include logging through jakarta commons/log4j.  Additionally, the build can now be performed by an ant build script.
The ant targets are:
build - Compiles all the wordnet libraries and utilities and creates the jwordnet_1.1.jar file.
build.browser - Compiles the wordnet browser and creates the jwordnet_browser.jar file.
